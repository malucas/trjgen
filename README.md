Support code for trajectory generation

This is a python library meant to support trajectory generation for autonomous vehicles. 

## Functionalities (Ongoing work):
- Generate trajectories, specifying waypoints in the flat-output space
- Take into account physical constraints of the plant (e.g. actuation capabilites)
- Nice representation of the result to help design/debug control applications
